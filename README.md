# Python bindings for tatami

## Overview

The **mattress** package implements Python bindings to the [**tatami**](https://github.com/tatami-inc/tatami) C++ library for matrix representations.
Downstream packages can use **mattress** to develop C++ extensions that are interoperable with many different matrix classes, e.g., dense, sparse, delayed or file-backed.
**mattress** is inspired by the [**beachmat**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/beachmat) Bioconductor package, which does the same thing for R packages.

## Instructions

**mattress** is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mattress/), so installation is simple:

```shell
pip install mattress
```

**mattress** is intended for Python package developers writing C++ extensions that operate on matrices.
The aim is to allow package C++ code to accept [all types of matrix representations](#supported-matrices) without requiring re-compilation of the associated code.
To achive this:

1. Add `mattress.includes()` and `assorthead.includes()` to the compiler's include path. 
This can be done through `include_dirs=` of the `Extension()` definition in `setup.py`
or by adding a `target_include_directories()` in CMake, depending on the build system.
2. Call `mattress.initialize()` on a Python matrix object to wrap it in a **tatami**-compatible C++ representation. 
This returns an `InitializedMatrix` with a `ptr` property that contains a pointer to the C++ matrix.
3. Pass `ptr` to C++ code as a `uintptr_t` referencing a `tatami::Matrix`,
which can be interrogated as described in the [**tatami** documentation](https://tatami-inc.github.io/tatami).

So, for example, the C++ code in our downstream package might look like the code below:

```cpp
#include "mattress.h"

int do_something(uintptr_t ptr) {
    const auto& mat_ptr = mattress::cast(ptr)->ptr;
    // Do something with the tatami interface.
    return 1;
}

// Assuming we're using pybind11, but any framework that can accept a uintptr_t is fine.
PYBIND11_MODULE(lib_downstream, m) {
    m.def("do_something", &do_something);
}
```

Which can then be called from Python:

```python
from . import lib_downstream as lib
from mattress import initialize

def do_something(x):
    tmat = initialize(x)
    return lib.do_something(tmat.ptr)
```

Check out [the included header](src/mattress/include/mattress.h) for more definitions.

## Supported matrices

Dense **numpy** matrices of varying numeric type:

```python
import numpy as np
from mattress import initialize
x = np.random.rand(1000, 100)
init = initialize(x)

ix = (x * 100).astype(np.uint16)
init2 = initialize(ix)
```

Compressed sparse matrices from **scipy** with varying index/data types:

```python
from scipy import sparse as sp
from mattress import initialize

xc = sp.random(100, 20, format="csc")
init = initialize(xc)

xr = sp.random(100, 20, format="csc", dtype=np.uint8)
init2 = initialize(xr)
```

Delayed arrays from the [**delayedarray**](https://github.com/BiocPy/DelayedArray) package:

```python
from delayedarray import DelayedArray
from scipy import sparse as sp
from mattress import initialize
import numpy

xd = DelayedArray(sp.random(100, 20, format="csc"))
xd = numpy.log1p(xd * 5)

init = initialize(xd)
```

Sparse arrays from **delayedarray** are also supported:

```python
import delayedarray
from numpy import float64, int32
from mattress import initialize
sa = delayedarray.SparseNdarray((50, 20), None, dtype=float64, index_dtype=int32)
init = initialize(sa)
```

See [below](#extending-to-custom-matrices) to extend `initialize()` to custom matrix representations. 

## Utility methods

The `InitializedMatrix` instance returned by `initialize()` provides a few Python-visible methods for querying the C++ matrix.

```python
init.nrow() // number of rows
init.column(1) // contents of column 1
init.sparse() // whether the matrix is sparse.
```

It also has a few methods for computing common statistics:

```python
init.row_sums()
init.column_variances(num_threads = 2)

grouping = [i%3 for i in range(init.ncol())]
init.row_medians_by_group(grouping)

init.row_nan_counts()
init.column_ranges()
```

These are mostly intended for non-intensive work or testing/debugging.
It is expected that any serious computation should be performed by iterating over the matrix in C++.

## Operating on an existing pointer

If we already have a `InitializedMatrix`, we can easily apply additional operations by wrapping it in the relevant **delayedarray** layers and calling `initialize()` afterwards.
For example, if we want to add a scalar, we might do:

```python
from delayedarray import DelayedArray
from mattress import initialize
import numpy

x = numpy.random.rand(1000, 10)
init = initialize(x)

wrapped = DelayedArray(init) + 1
init2 = initialize(wrapped)
```

This is more efficient as it re-uses the `InitializedMatrix` already generated from `x`.
It is also more convenient as we don't have to carry around `x` to generate `init2`.

## Extending to custom matrices

Developers can extend **mattress** to custom matrix classes by registering new methods with the `initialize()` generic.
This should return a `InitializedMatrix` object containing a `uintptr_t` cast from a pointer to a `tatami::Matrix` (see [the included header](src/mattress/include/mattress.h)).
Once this is done, all calls to `initialize()` will be able to handle matrices of the newly registered types.

```python
from . import lib_downstream as lib
import mattress

@mattress.initialize.register
def _initialize_my_custom_matrix(x: MyCustomMatrix):
    data = x.some_internal_data
    return mattress.InitializedMatrix(lib.initialize_custom(data))
```

If the initialized `tatami::Matrix` contains references to Python-managed data, e.g., in NumPy arrays,
we must ensure that the data is not garbage-collected during the lifetime of the `tatami::Matrix`.
This is achieved by storing a reference to the data in the `original` member of the `mattress::BoundMatrix`.
